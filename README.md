# SMARAN-optimizer

This repository contains the implementation of the SMARAN optimizer, a novel optimization algorithm designed for efficient training of deep learning models. It includes modular components for configuration, dataset handling, model definition, training routines, and evaluation utilities.

## Files included:
- `config.py`: Configuration settings for training and evaluation.
- `datasets.py`: Dataset loading and preprocessing.
- `main.py`: Entry point for running training and evaluation.
- `models.py`: Model architecture definitions.
- `optimizers.py`: Implementation of the SMARAN optimizer.
- `trainer.py`: Training loop and evaluation logic.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for logging, metrics, and reproducibility.

## Usage
To train a model using the SMARAN optimizer, run:
```bash
python main.py
